Getting started

To get started with MakinSense, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the MakinSense CN trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/makinsense/android.git -b A13
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
